                                                        and symbols; arrow keys move the cursor, and "B" draws a vector from
                                                        the last point to the current cursor location.

40tp_tse-4_supGrid.ptp                  PTR     100     Appears to be a basic visual Text Editor.  Ensure Bit 0 of DS is set
                                                        when running.

core16k                                 TTY     Auto    Displays an octal dump of core onscreen.  Arrow keys scroll through
                                                        memory, an address can be typed in at the bottom left of the screen,
                                                        hitting space wil jump to that address.  Unsure if memory can be edited.

coreop                                  TTY     Auto    Displays a basic disassembly of core contents.  Arrow keys scroll, an
                                                        address can be typed in at the bottom left, space will jump to that 
                                                        address.

crash                                   TTY     Auto    Unknown.  (Perhaps a variant of crashmit.txt below.  Does not currently 
                                                        run.)

crashmit.txt                            STTY    Auto    Simple "Lunar Lander" clone; currently runs extremely fast making it
                                                        unplayable.  Arrow keys control thrust.

imquad                                  TTY     Auto    "Space War!" clone.  Data Switches are used as controls (unsure of exact
                                                        mapping).  DS 0 must be set.  CR restarts.

integerMath.ptp                         N/A     N/A     Assembly code, presumably for integer math routines.

keybrd.txt                              STTY    Auto    "Keyboard Diagnostic 1."  Displays onscreen keyboard, keys borders light
                                                        up as keys are pressed.  Row of numbers at the top shows repeat count,
                                                        scancode, and third number of unknown purpose (appears to always be 0).

lemwar                                  TTY     Auto    "Lunar Lander" clone, appears to be unfinished.  Arrow keys control 
                                                        thrust, CR restarts.

life                                    STTY    Auto    Conway's "Game Of Life".  Set DS bit 0 to run.  Arrow keys move cursor
                                                        around grid.  "C" toggles a cell on or off, "Q" resets the grid, "R"
                                                        runs a single step, "G" runs continuously, and "H" halts the run.

maze                                    TTY     Auto    Generates mazes (hit CR when the grid appears to start) and places a mouse
                                                        at one side and a cheese wedge at the other; use the arrow keys to move
                                                        the mouse through the maze.

munch                                   TTY     Auto    The famous "Munching Squares" demo.  Change the DS switch settings to 
                                                        generate different patterns.  Trippy.

newapollo                               STTY    Auto    Another "Lunar Lander" clone.  Use arrow keys to adjust thrust, CR to
                                                        restart.  Ensure DS bit 0 is set.

nspwar                                  TTY     Auto    Another space war clone; unsure of the controls -- all I can do at the moment
                                                        is make my ship explode.  (May use data switches -- DS 0 must be set to run.)
